# 🔍 Logfire LLM Tracing Demo

This repository demonstrates how to use [Logfire](https://logfire.dev) to trace LLM calls in Python using the `@trace` decorator. It’s a hands-on example of real-time observability for AI apps, complete with token tracking, function-level logging, and prompt visibility.

Ideal for developers building with OpenAI, LangChain, or custom agent architectures who want structured debugging, cost tracking, and reproducible logs.
